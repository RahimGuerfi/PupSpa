## Project Goals

Let’s practice what we’ve just learned about CSS Grid through building a classic, grid-based, responsive web page. Your friend has just opened a doggie daycare and grooming services shop, PupSpa. They would like a simple web page to let customers know about their services.

We currently have an HTML document styled with CSS, but every `<div>` appears in its own row. Let’s add some CSS grid properties to make parts of the site appear more cohesive. Some of the properties we’ll by using include:

> - display
> - grid-template-rows
> - grid-template-columns
> - grid-gap
> - grid-column-start
> - grid-column-end

We’ll also cover a couple of the shorthand properties of these as well.
